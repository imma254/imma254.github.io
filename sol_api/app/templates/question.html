                            Any support for use of regex checks for e-mails I am 100% against. I'm tired of being told my e-mail address of "foo+bar@gmail.com" is invalid. The best option is to ask the user to type their e-mail in twice and if you MUST use a regex checker, then tell the user that their e-mail address does not appear to be valid and ask if they are sure they typed it right. Even go so far as to point out WHAT did not check out in the regexp check, but do NOT stop them from submitting the form.
